This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function that expects a string. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a solution.  The error arises because the `greeter` function explicitly expects a string argument, but an array is provided. The solution involves either modifying the function signature to accept an array or changing the function call to pass a string.
